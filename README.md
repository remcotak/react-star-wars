# Star Wars
This application is created by Remco Tak. The application uses content from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).

The application contains:
* HTML5
* SASS
* BEM
* Webpack
* Hot Module Replacement
* React with ES6
* React Redux
* Redux Thunk
* React Router
* ESLint

`git clone https://github.com/remcotak/react-star-wars.git`

Navigate to the directory.

Run the application, this will start the webpack dev server and open the application in your browser.

## Notes
This application is far from done. The base has been set but I will continue to be working on the application.
